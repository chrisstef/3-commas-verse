## My commit for Schelling Point Virtual Hackathon ⚡

A **React** web app built for **3Commas** during the Schelling Point Virtual Hackathon on **Gitcoin**. This project was the top winner in Competition 2: Design a business tool for 3Commas traders!


## Deployed Project 🌐

https://3-commas-verse.vercel.app/


## Project Overview 🚀

''In this repository I built a web app which displays various crypto **details** and **useful news**, for **traders** in real time.''<br>
Users can search prices and news related to the crypto of **their choice**.


In depth we are...

- Utilizing **RapidAPI** to fetch data from 2 different API's ( Coinranking, Bing News Search) with **custom Hooks**.

- Managing our States with **Redux**.

- Using **Ant Design** to create our UI.

- Rendering charts using **Chart.js**.

The components are fully-functional so feel free to navigate around as well as view on **mobile**. In mobile version please view chart in **landscape mode** for a better experience. 

**Note:** Under **heavy traffic** the app will break because I'm using a free RapidAPI key and that limits the amount of requests the webserver can send.


## Future Ideas 💭

There are a lot of things to be implemented since the app is build with components and is easy to modify them.

Some of them..

- Add **technical indicators** which would make **algorithmic trading** applicable.

- Connect our app with the **3CommasApi** for more **advanced trading endpoints**.

- Add **dark-Mode** button.
