# My Commit for Schelling Point Virtual Hackathon


## Project Overview 🚀

''In this repository I built a **web app** which displays cryptocurrencies details and news useful for **traders** in real time. ''<br>
The App was build with React JS.


In depth we are...

- Using **RapidAPI** to fetch data from 2 different API's ( Coinranking, Bing News Search) with **custom Hooks**.

- Managing our States with **Redux**.

- Using **Ant Design** to create our UI.

- Rendering charts using **Chart.js**.

The components are **full functional** and **responsive** so feel free to navigate around as well as view on **mobile**. In mobile version view chart in **landscape mode** for a better experience. 


## Future Ideas 💭

There can be a lot of things to be implemented since the app is created using **minimal code** and therefore it's adaptable.

Some of them..

- Add **technical indicators** on the chart which would make **algorithmic trading** applicable.

- Connect our app with the **3CommasApi** for more advanced endpoints for trading.

- Add **dark Mode** button.
